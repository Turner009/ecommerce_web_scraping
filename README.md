What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
    
    The biggest challenge in scraping the website was dealing with the popup that asked to accept cookies.    

What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?

    The insight I gained from the visualization is that most laptop prices fall between the  $200 - $600 or $1000 - $1400 range with few  options in between or above those ranges. There does not seem to be any correlation between price and number of reviews. I would have thought the more affordable items would have had more reviews. Due to having more sales.
